This project uses Reddit data from r/wallstreetbets to predict stock prices. The dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/shergreen/wallstreetbets-subreddit-submissions?select=investing_submission.json has been used here, but any other dataset will suffice.

Some of the initial data can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Acg8v9QXAIwENi3GjdgyI9vOcBk0ksHQH4We_IQz-Q/edit#gid=715148225
